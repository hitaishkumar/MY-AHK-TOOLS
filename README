hello!!

the script to GET YOUTUBE THUMBNAIL works with the shortcut ( CTRL + F10)
you NEED to have your chrome window active,( i havent tested it in other browsers. )

if you are having problem with your browser, remove this line from the script and try again, (#IfWinActive ahk_class Chrome_WidgetWin_1 ).
 
if you understand the code feel free to add more comments and additional parameters and dont forget to tell me at : hitaishkumar44@gmail.com

i have been using this code from quite some time for my editing work and have fixed a lot of issues, but i am still no programmer and cannot adhere to its 100% ACCURACY.
 nonetheless it works quite well.
 
 PROCEDURE TO USE:
 1. RIGHT CLICK on any youtube video .( currently running on focus / in the side suggestion bars )
 2. Click on " COPY LINK ADDRESS" or " COPY VIDEO URL" if its the video you are curently watching.
 3. the youtube video URL is now copied to your clipboard 
 4. press CTRL + F10 
 5. a new tab will open with the THUMBNAIL in its highest quality.
 6. rejoice and maybe learn more AHK. :)
